# K-Means Clustering, PCA Analysis on Cryptocurrency Returns

This application extensively uses the sklearn library, particularly K-Means clustering and PCA. It was created to run K-Means clustering on various cryptocurrencies and their price changes along different timeframes. In addition to K-Means clustering, this program explores simplifying higher dimensionality datasets with PCA analysis.
